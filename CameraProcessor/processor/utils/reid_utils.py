    """Slices the bounding box out of the image given
    Args:
        bbox (BoundingBox): A boundingbox which holds the rectangle we need
        img (np.ndarray): the numpy array representing the frame/image

    Returns:
         np.ndarray: a REFERENCE to a lisce of the original image

    IMPORTANT: DO NOT ALTER THE RETURNED IMAGE SLICE DIRECTLY! This will alter the original image. If you absolutely
    need to do something to it, use copy() first. This is unrecommended, since copying an array is costly.

    ALSO IMPORTANT: The original image will continue to exist in memory as long as the reference made here continues
    to exist. To let Python garbage collection free the memory, you have to assign the variable to something new, or
    use `del`.

    Example:
        a = slice_bounding_box(bbox, img) # Assign variable a to reference the slice
        img = None # Remove the reference to the original image. IT IS STILL RETAINED IN MEMORY!!
        a = None # However, now that the slice of the image is also unreferenced, Python garbage collection will free up
                   the memory

        reference to the original image.

    Returns:
         np.ndarray: A resized image, which will also be a reference. Therefore, any adjustments to the original
         image reflect on this resized slice of the image too. But maybe not the other way around, since I am not sure
         if this constitutes a "shallow copy"!
