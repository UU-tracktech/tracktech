    Main thread runs the implementation with open, close and getting the next frame.
    Separate thread runs the reading loop, which reads the next frame at a constant rate.
    Another thread gets the time stamp of the stream once and going from there.

        hls_url (str): Url of hls stream.
        fps (int): FPS of the stream

        __start_time_stamp (float): Start time of capture object.
        __frame_time_stamp (float): Time stamp of current frame.
        __last_frame_time_stamp (float): Time stamp of previous frame.
        __hls_start_time_stamp (float): Start time of hls stream.

        __thread_start_time (float): Start time of thread.
        __wait_ms (float): Time between frames in ms

        __current_frame (numpy.ndarray): The current frame.

        __previous_time (float): a time float to determine the time diff between frame readings.
        __timeout (int): an integer for timeout in seconds (used as float).
        __grace_period (int): an integer denoting a grace period at the start before we check for a timeout.
        __retries (int): the number of retries before connecting is given up

        __thread_running (bool): bool denoting whether reading thread is active or activating.

        __reading_thread (Thread): Contains thread that reads.
        __reconnect_thread (Thread): Contains thread that attempts to reconnect if connection was closed unexpectedly

        __reconnecting (bool): Boolean indicating reconnect procedure must be started
        __drop_reconnect (bool): Boolean indicating the reconnect thread can be closed
        __found_stream (bool): Boolean indicating whether stream was found.
