"""Tracking object component and dict to manage objects.

This file contains a class for tracking objects. Creating an object will automatically add it to a dictionary, which
it removes itself from upon removal.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
