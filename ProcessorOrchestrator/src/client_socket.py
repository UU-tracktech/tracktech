"""Client component to handle client websocket connections.

This file contains a websocket class to handle websocket connections coming from clients (using the interface).
It defines multiple functions that can be called using specified json messages.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
