The first thing that needs to be done is to install the chromedriver, so selenium is able to debug on chrome. Select the
latest version of the driver.

    https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=88.0.4324.96/

Make sure that the path in omgevingsvariabelen includes the path to the chromedriver

Please not that if the driver is outdated, then a driver update will be required to run the latest version.

The next step is to install python, you can check which version of python is installed by typing the following command in cmd

    python --version

The next thing that is required is that Selenium for python is installed on the pc, this can be done by typing the
following command in the cmd:

    pip install -U selenium

In order to run Selenium jdk is required, in order to fix that we need to download it at:

    https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

The last step is to install the ide required to run selenium, in our case this will be pycharm community edition at

    https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

The selenium Testing.py should be able to be run after these installation steps are completed.
